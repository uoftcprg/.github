Since its formation, the **University of Toronto Computer Poker Student Research Group** has been a forum for both formal and informal discourse in the field of computer poker within the University of Toronto community. Most members in the group are students from the University of Toronto, but we maintain good relations with groups of similar interest from other universities. The group carries out research and/or develops open-source tools to further the worldâ€™s poker community often under the guidance of various University of Toronto Professors.

Our group developed various open-source software projects related to poker, some of which have established widespread use in the computer poker community as the de-facto software solution. Their usages range from poker game simulation, hand evaluation, table management, to tournament management. Our online poker game platform LibrePoker, is used by the **University of Toronto Poker Club** to host various online events.
